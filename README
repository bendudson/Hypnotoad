                      Hypnotoad 
                      =========

A field-aligned structured mesh generator for tokamaks.

Takes a G-EQDSK format input file (from e.g EFIT), and produces
a mesh which can be used for simulation codes

To run the code, go into IDL

IDL> hypnotoad

Features
--------

Processing consists of the following steps

 o Reading equilibria (read_neqdsk.pro)
 o Analysing to find x-points and o-points (analyse_equil.pro)
 o Creating a mesh (create_grid.pro)
 o Processing the mesh to produce output for BOUT++ (process_grid.pro)

Each of these files contains comments describing what their inputs
and outputs are.

All of these steps can be done automatically in a script (see test.pro)
except for process_grid.pro currently. This is because often meshes
from EFIT need to be adjusted first before they can be used, so processing
currently needs some user interaction.

For processing step: Answer "No" to all questions if in doubt.

The hypnotoad GUI provides an interface, but doesn't do any processing
so it's not needed. This is so everything can be automated if needed.

The main feature is that the mesh generation tries to be very forgiving.
If it comes across a problem in the settings, it will try to find better
settings and retry. After a number of retries it will eventually give up.


Limitations
-----------

o Currently only outputs for BOUT++, although adapting to other formats
  should be possible. See the output of create_mesh.pro and see what
  process_grid does with it

o The mesh is currently only orthogonal. This means that it can't properly
  conform to boundaries e.g. target plates. This is more difficult to
  change, but is planned
